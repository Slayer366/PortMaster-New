# Nox-Decomp

An excellent action/RPG hybrid with very unique gameplay. 
Your name is Jack Mower, a 20th century dude who just happened to be sucked into the world of Nox via his TV set. 
The world is in danger and you have to save it! But before you embark on your epic 
journey you must choose your path: warrior, wizard, or conjurer.

Unofficial **Nox (2000)** port to Linux based on decompiled code from playnox.xyz.

This is the version with all the patches needed to make it work well.
[sookyboo/nox-decomp](https://github.com/sookyboo/nox-decomp)

Used this archived project [neuromancer/nox-decomp](https://github.com/neuromancer/nox-decomp) as a starting point.

Single player and multiplayer on the internet and LAN work great!


> **Note:** This project does **not** include any Nox game assets. You must own a legitimate copy of Nox to play.

## Thanks

Thanks to my wife for giving me the time to work on this.

Thanks to my brother for playing this game with me when I was growing up.

Thanks to OpenNox for implementing a modern lobby server which enables internet games and for labeling functions in their code which made navigating the code easier.

Thanks to klops, JanTrueno, Dia, Fraxinus88, OGM, Ganimoth, NotYerAvgPorter, Hades-Arcadius, MrGiKILL and Cebion for contributing fixes, advice and testing.

Also thanks to the PortMaster team for the work they do - porting is a lot of work!

## Known Issues

* Minor glitch on the last column of pixels on text only on some characters - barely noticeable - all text is legible.
* Minor glitch on death rays appearing in shadows when they should be hidden from view.
* Slightly slow when there are dozens of enemies on screen but this doesn't happen frequently.
* Some slow downs in fade outs and fade ins. (This is due to the way that the game is being drawn and was present in the original game I think)
* All graphics are totally corrupted in 8-bit color mode but work in 16-bit color mode but we don't use 8-bit color mode in this port.

## Multiplayer
"Multiplay->Westwood Online" menu item doesn't work anymore because the Westwood Studios company is no longer operating.
Internet multiplayer games can be accessed from "Multiplay->Network" and are the first servers listed.

LAN games have a default name of "User Game"
"Host Game/Host Quest" can be used to host a game on your LAN/WiFi network locally.

Internet multiplayer games: The "Kor) Newbies" server makes the game exit but this happens on OpenNox too so might be a bad server.
The "Kor) Newbies" server has been excluded from the multiplayer list for now. 

## Korean Language
Make a `gamefiles/app/Dialog` directory before installing the game and copy the Korean dialog files there. 
Please note that dialog conversion will take around 20min for English and another 20min for the Korean audio files.

## Getting the Game Data

Copy the GOG installer "setup_nox_*.exe" into gamefiles directory. Then run the game.
Extraction of the GOG installer will take around 10 minutes and conversion of the dialog audio files will take 20min. 

## Tips
-   It is worth watching the game story video introduction once in the main menu by pressing "Play Intro"
-   Your device might be able to handle better graphics - when in the game go to main menu->options (**Select**) experiment with these:
  -   High Res Front Walls
  -   High Res Floors
  -   Soft Shadow Edge
  -   Render Particle Glow
  -   Fade Objects
  -   Render Bubbles (in mana and health viles)
  -   Draw Front Walls (I prefer this off)
  -   Translucent Front Walls
-   Save often using **Start + Right D-Pad** and load often with **Start + Left D-Pad**.
-   Running into things like chests, doors, switches, tree stumps will open them.
-   If inventory / book / merchant / video is open press **Select** to exit any of them quickly. 
-   Use **L2** to slow down the mouse for picking up items, navigating menus or issuing commands to creatures as a conjurer
-   If you are a conjurer you can issue commands to your creatures in the top right window
-   Small screens might make the game harder
  -   Opening the mini map on each level can make it easier (**Start + A**)
  -   Zooming the map can help you find unexplored areas 
-   Something almost always comes out of a chest look carefully for items like arrow quivers
-   Take time to organise your spell lists - you can drag spells from the book
  -   Spell buttons/analog stick are clockwise from the order on the bottom of the screen for first four
  -   The last/fith spell at the bottom of the screen can be used with **L1 + R1**
  -   Cycle through your spell set ups with **L1 + Up D-Pad/Down D-Pad** press the little square to drag spells from your spell book into the different spell rows
  -   A spell ordering I like and is easy to memorise: Up for healing, down for dealing heavy damage, right for running/evading/hiding, left for slowing/hindering/confusing enemy, L1 + R1 for prep/shield spells
-   You can drag and drop items from your inventory
-   Most obstacles can be overcome with thinking, prepping, saving and reloading - rather than mouse speed
-   Most of the levels are completely different and have different challenges for the three classes Conjurer, Wizard and Warrior. It is worth playing through all of them. Conjurers can control creatures and have spells, Wizards can't control creatures but have powerful spells, Warriors have no magic but are stronger and faster and have special skills. 
-   Multiplayer is extremely fun too - I encourage you to try it with friends - Online games and local WiFi/LAN games co-op and versus are possible up to 32 players.
-   You can see what the status icons are with your inventory open by hovering over them.
-   Weapons and armour do eventually break unless you repair them - break boxes/walls with a cheap weapon and repair your favourites.
-   Look for tree stumps, secret walls and areas - they often reward you with items/gold that can help you finish the level or game.
-   Different merchants have different prices - keep your original shirt and use it to compare selling prices at different merchants to get the best deal.
-   Later in the game it is possible to set traps and these are sometimes useful for tough enemies but not always.

## Crash debuging 

Although there are no known persistent crashes in the wizard and conjurer campaigns and multiplayer.

There may be crashes on parts of the game that haven't been tested so save often.

If you experience a consistent crash on a particular event.

Zip up and send me your save game folder conf/Save on the portmaster discord server.
You will also need to tell me the name/time of the save and describe what
action you took to make the game crash so that I can test the fix works. 
Please report crashes or I can't fix them for everyone. 

If you are technical you can get a stack trace with this:
```
# How to debug
# while ! pid=$(pgrep noxd); do sleep 0.1; done;  gdb -p "$pid"
# launch the game from the launcher 
# in gdb type c to continue
# play the game until the crash
# on crash type bt in gdb to get stack trace
```

Why not OpenNox - OpenNox has an added layer of complexity to convert to ARM32. 
Working through this project may actually help get OpenNox working on ARM32 one day.

This layer centralises all “meta” controls (saving, loading, console, and map) on the controller.

God mode has been modified so that it doesn't alter your spells/creature knowledge.

WARNING: With cheats sage mode messes with your spells and spell levels - and is disabled by default in nox.gptk2.ini. 
Sage gives you all spells, unset sage removes ALL spells including ones you learned the hard way.
Recommend not enabling sage mode unless you know what you're doing and save before.
If you enable it the game might remember and may mess with your spells in future saves.


Please Note: That for cheats to work it requires a new version of gptokeyb2 included with PortMaster. 
You may have to update to the latest PortMaster in order for it to work.

### Multiplayer Layer (Hold **Start** and **Guide**)

While holding **Start** and **Guide**

| Button (Start and Guide held) | Keyboard                                | Action in Nox                           |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Right Analog ↑**            | `F1`                                    | Open/close console                      |
| **Right Analog →**            | cycle chat responses or character names | cycle chat responses or character names |
| **Right Analog ←**            | cycle chat responses or character names | cycle chat responses or character names |
| **Right Analog ↓**            | apply active response or character name | apply active response or character name |
| **Y**                         | cancel active text                      | cancel active text                      |

Please Note: That for multiplayer chat / character name selectionto work it requires a new version of gptokeyb2 included with PortMaster.
You may have to update to the latest PortMaster in order for it to work.

export NOX_CONTROL_SERVER_SLEEP_SCALE=1 # some ennvironments might be slow so you can increase the sleep time between commands 
export NOX_CONTROL_SERVER_BOOT="macro server;" # You can issue control server commands on start

# The macro server uses some env vars and sets up a multiplayer game
export NOX_SERVER_NAME=NoxDecompServer # when starting a game what the server is called 
export NOX_SERVER_SYSOP=secret # set the sysop password to secret for multiplayer games
export NOX_SERVER_LESSONS=15
export NOX_SERVER_TIME:0
export NOX_SERVER_DEFAULT_MAP:capflag # game type becomes whatever the map default is

export NOX_CAPTURE_INPUT=0   # prints out real user mouse input but mostly useless too noisy 
```

### Other env vars
```
export NOX_SKIP_INTRO_MOVIES=0 # default is 1 - skip the logo movies at the start of the game

# NOX_LIMIT_RANGE_ON_RUN - useful for gamepads and steam deck 
# limits the range of the mouse when running but only if starting close to center or passing through center
export NOX_LIMIT_RANGE_ON_RUN=1 #default is 0
export NOX_LIMIT_RANGE_ON_RUN_RADIUS=110 # default is 110 - the radius of the circle   
```
