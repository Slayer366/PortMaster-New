    <desc>It may be the most fun action RPG you've never played and supports multiplayer. An excellent action/RPG hybrid with very unique gameplay. Your name is Jack Mower, a 20th century dude who just happened to be sucked into the world of Nox via his TV set. The world is in danger and you have to save it! But before you embark on your epic journey you must choose your path: warrior, wizard, or conjurer. Nox-Decomp is a source port of Westwood Studios Nox from https://github.com/sookyboo/nox-decomp</desc>
