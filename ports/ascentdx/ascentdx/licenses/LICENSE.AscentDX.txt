Hi there,
cool project!
II think having the game distributed via PortMaster directly sounds good. Having to grab the exe from steam sounds annoying. 

What are the possibilities to include credits/links to my sites? A big reason for me doing free games is that it drives traffic, and I'm not sure how that would work in this case.

Hello Johan,
My name is [REDACTED] (Fraxinus88), and I’m part of a group of developers working on porting games to handheld Linux devices. Our project is called PortMaster and may be found at https://portmaster.games/, and we also have an active Discord community that you’re welcome to check out anytime.
I’ve managed to get Ascent DX running on my RGB30, though it required some modifications to your game files. These devices often use OpenGL ES, so certain GLSL shader syntax isn’t compatible and needs patching. Here’s a picture of the game running:
 
Because your .lua files state “Copyright (c) 2025 Apskeppet AB, Johan Peitz,” I’d like to request permission to distribute a PortMaster package that includes modifications to some .lua files (particularly graphics.lua) to make the game work on ARM-based devices.
Our current plan is for users to download the game from Steam to obtain ascent_dx.exe for patching. However, it would be amazing if you’d allow PortMaster to distribute the game directly.
Either way, thank you for creating such awesome games! I’ve been a fan since discovering PICO-8 and have purchased Shadow King on Itch.io as well 🙂
Best regards,
