    <desc>Ascent DX is a tiny metroidvania brought to life in glorious 64 x 64 pixel art and soothing chiptune music. Crashed on an unknown planet you have to explore lush jungles, lifeless deserts, and luminescent caves in search of anything that can help you understand what has happened to the planet and how to get off it.

While the game is a bigger version of the original Ascent, with almost twice as many locations to explore, it is still quite a short game. With the same celebrated gameplay and atmosphere, the DX versions also brings more items to find, more platforming puzzles, and more lore to uncover. </desc>
