When importing multiple versions into *Jazz² Resurrection*, copy each game's files into `ports/jazz2/Source/`—in the order listed above—replacing all files each time.\n\nSome releases of *The Secret Files* contain an extra `xmas1.j2l` file which shouldn't be there. This file breaks *The Christmas Chronicles*. To fix this issue, either do not copy the file, or, replace it with the version of the file from *The Christmas Chronicles*. *Holiday Hare '98* and *The Christmas Chronicles* are nearly identical, except that *The Christmas Chronicles* also contains Lori as playable character, so it is the preferred version. The *Secret Files Demo* is not supported, only the original *Shareware Demo* is.",
